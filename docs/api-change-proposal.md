# API Change Proposal

You're here because you have a proposition for an API change. And you're in the right place.

We have a structured process to review and approve API changes. This document is your guide to help you through the process.

## Process Overview

**Ideation**

If you're unsure about the idea, you can start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/shopware/api-working-group/discussions) to get early feedback.

**Proposal**

If you have a concrete idea, you can create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/shopware/api-working-group/pulls) with your proposal.

**Implementation**

Once the proposal is approved, the implementation will be done by you or the respective development team.

## Workspace structure

We take care of the consultation for different kinds of Public APIs. Currently the structure looks like this:

```
design-decisions
│ README.md
│
└─── rest-store-api
│ │ 2025-02-26-readContext.md
│ │ 2025-03-01-searchPage.md
│ │ ...
└─── rest-admin-api
│ │ 2024-12-31-getProductList.md
└─── php-module
│ │ 2025-02-01-createCustomer.md
```
